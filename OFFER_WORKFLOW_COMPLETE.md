## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

```jsx
// Modern component composition with real-time updates
const OffersDashboard = () => {
  const [offers, setOffers] = useState([]);
  const [showConfirmModal, setShowConfirmModal] = useState(false);
  
  // Real-time Firebase integration
  useEffect(() => {
    const offersQuery = query(
      collection(db, 'offers'),
      where('studentId', '==', currentUser.uid),
      orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')
    );
    
    const unsubscribe = onSnapshot(offersQuery, (snapshot) => {
      const offersData = snapshot.docs.map(doc => ({
        id: doc.id,
        ...doc.data()
      }));
      setOffers(offersData);
    });
    
    return () => unsubscribe();
  }, [currentUser]);
  
  return (
    <OffersContainer>
      <AnimatePresence>
        {offers.map(offer => (
          <OfferCard key={offer.id} offer={offer} />
        ))}
      </AnimatePresence>
    </OffersContainer>
  );
};
```

### **Firebase Integration**
```javascript
// Comprehensive Firestore structure
const offersCollection = {
  offerId: 'auto-generated',
  companyId: 'company-uuid',
  companyName: 'TechCorp Inc.',
  companyLogo: 'logo-url',
  studentId: 'student-uuid',
  studentName: 'John Doe',
  studentDepartment: 'Computer Science',
  role: 'Software Engineering Intern',
  stipend: 50000,
  duration: '3 months',
  location: 'Bangalore',
  deadline: timestamp,
  status: 'pending', // pending, accepted, rejected, auto-rejected
  createdAt: serverTimestamp(),
  updatedAt: serverTimestamp(),
  acceptedAt: null,
  rejectedAt: null
};

// Security rules for role-based access
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /offers/{offerId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && (
        resource.data.studentId == request.auth.uid ||
        hasRole('placement') ||
        hasRole('admin') ||
        (hasRole('recruiter') && resource.data.companyId == getUserCompany())
      );
      
      allow update: if request.auth != null && 
        resource.data.studentId == request.auth.uid &&
        request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys()
          .hasOnly(['status', 'updatedAt', 'acceptedAt', 'rejectedAt']);
    }
  }
}
```

### **Animation System**
```javascript
// Framer Motion integration with spring physics
const cardVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 20, scale: 0.95 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    y: 0,
    scale: 1,
    transition: {
      type: "spring",
      stiffness: 300,
      damping: 20
    }
  }
};

const countdownVariants = {
  urgent: {
    scale: [1, 1.05, 1],
    transition: {
      duration: 1.5,
      repeat: Infinity,
      ease: "easeInOut"
    }
  }
};

// Confetti animation system
const ConfettiPiece = styled(motion.div)`
  position: absolute;
  width: 8px;
  height: 8px;
  background: ${({ color }) => color};
  border-radius: 2px;
`;

const celebrateAcceptance = () => {
  return [...Array(50)].map((_, i) => (
    <ConfettiPiece
      key={i}
      color={confettiColors[i % 5]}
      initial={{ x: Math.random() * window.innerWidth, y: -10 }}
      animate={{ y: window.innerHeight + 10, rotate: 360 }}
      transition={{ duration: 3, delay: i * 0.02 }}
    />
  ));
};
```
