```jsx
// Modern component composition
const ResumeBuilder = () => {
  const [resumeData, setResumeData] = useState(initialState);
  const [completionPercentage, setCompletionPercentage] = useState(0);
  
  // Real-time preview updates
  const handleResumeUpdate = (updatedData) => {
    setResumeData(updatedData);
    setShowUpdateIndicator(true);
    // Trigger skill extraction alerts
    if (updatedData.skills.length > resumeData.skills.length) {
      setShowSkillAlert(true);
    }
  };
  
  return (
    <BuilderLayout>
      <ResumeBuilderForm onResumeUpdate={handleResumeUpdate} />
      <ResumePreview resumeData={resumeData} onDownload={handleDownload} />
    </BuilderLayout>
  );
};
```

### **AI Skill Extraction Engine**
```javascript
// Advanced NLP-based extraction
class ResumeParser {
  extractSkills(text) {
    const extractedSkills = new Set();
    const skillConfidence = new Map();
    
    // Multi-layer extraction
    this.extractByDirectMatch(text, extractedSkills, skillConfidence);
    this.extractBySynonyms(text, extractedSkills, skillConfidence);
    this.extractByContext(text, extractedSkills, skillConfidence);
    this.extractByPatterns(text, extractedSkills, skillConfidence);
    
    return {
      skills: Array.from(extractedSkills).map(skill => ({
        name: skill,
        confidence: skillConfidence.get(skill) || 0.5,
        category: this.getSkillCategory(skill)
      })),
      confidence: this.calculateOverallConfidence(extractedSkills)
    };
  }
}
```

### **Firebase Integration**
```javascript
// Complete Firebase operations
const resumeParser = {
  async saveResumeData(userId, resumeData, resumeFile) {
    // Upload PDF to Storage
    const resumeURL = await this.uploadResumeFile(userId, resumeFile);
    
    // Save to Firestore
    await setDoc(doc(db, 'users', userId, 'resume', 'data'), {
      ...resumeData,
      resumeURL,
      lastUpdated: serverTimestamp()
    });
    
    return { success: true, resumeURL };
  }
};
```

### **Animation System**
```javascript
// Framer Motion animations
const sectionVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    y: 0,
    transition: { duration: 0.5, staggerChildren: 0.1 }
